CIRM Data Browser says that kriegsteinRadialGliaStudy1 is:

Number of files: 401
Total size: 2.9 GB

My computer says it's 3.1 GB and my python script says it's 403 files. 

Lines 87 and 88 of the HTML say:
<b>Number of files:</b> 401<br>
<b>Total size:</b> 2.9 GB<p>

I changed them to:
<b>Number of files:</b> 403<br>
<b>Total size:</b> 3.1 GB<p>
